## Implementation Details

### Profile Page (`/profile/page.js`)

The main profile page uses a client-side component approach with React's `useState` and `useRef` hooks to manage state and file inputs. Key features include:

- **Image Uploads**: Uses FileReader API to preview images before upload
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS
- **Mock Data**: Currently uses mock data that would be replaced with API calls in production

### Edit Profile Page (`/profile/edit/page.js`)

The edit profile page allows users to update their profile information:

- **Form Handling**: Uses controlled form components with React state
- **Form Validation**: Includes basic validation for required fields
- **Success/Error Messages**: Displays feedback after form submission
- **Navigation**: Returns to the profile page after successful updates

### Placeholder Images

The profile uses SVG placeholder images for demonstration purposes:

- `/public/images/profile-placeholder.svg`: Default profile photo
- `/public/images/cover-placeholder.svg`: Default cover photo

## Future Enhancements

1. **Backend Integration**: Connect to a real API for user data and image uploads
2. **Image Optimization**: Add image cropping and resizing functionality
3. **Social Media Links**: Add options to connect social media accounts
4. **Activity History**: Show recent activity and interactions
5. **Privacy Settings**: Add controls for what information is visible to others
